// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (General Upgrade Configurations)
// Version 1.2
// Created: 31 October 2020 for KSP 1.9.1 to 1.10.1
// Last Updated: 23 November 2020
// 19 November 2020: Added general settings for Kerbalism and Engine Ignitor
// 22 November 2020: Added Science Difficulty Setting
// 23 November 2020: Added upgrade toggle switches
// 28 November 2020: Added cost multipliers for various parts (not yet implemented in-game)

// IMPORTANT NOTE: These settings are not foolproof.  Incorrect settings can break your game!!!!  Change only after you have backed up your save!
// If using a patch either do not specify a pass or use the :FIRST pass to ensure that your patch runs before any Kiwi Tech Tree patches reference them.

		SAS = on				// Options: on/off Turning off will disable the Probe SAS upgrades in KTT.  Note that this result in the default SAS level for all probes and they may be out of order in the tech tree.  I will not balance accordingly.
